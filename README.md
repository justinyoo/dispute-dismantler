# Dispute Dismantler (DD): Entertainment-Fueled Conflict Resolution App

Welcome to **Dispute Dismantler (DD)**, the AI-powered application that infuses the art of conflict resolution with a dose of entertainment. This whimsical app delivers a unique way to handle trivial squabbles, all while echoing the sarcastic charm of Bender from the beloved show *Futurama*.

### About:

Dispute Dismantler is designed to transform mundane disagreements—from pizza toppings to movie selections—into moments of laughter and fun. It leverages advanced AI to consider arguments from both sides, delivering responses and verdicts that are drenched in Bender-like snark.

### How DD Works:

When contention arises, simply:

1. Open the **Dispute Dismantler** app.
2. Hit the **LISTEN** button and present your differing points of view.
3. Observe as the app displays a transcript of the conversation, aligning text on the screen to represent each participant's perspective.
4. If DD mix-ups whose argument is whose, quickly swipe the text to the proper side of the screen.
5. Press the **TALK** button when you're ready for DD's judgment and be prepared for a decision that could range from serious guidance to a witty remark aimed at defusing the situation.

### Key Features:

- **Voice-Activated Argument Analysis**: Just talk, and DD listens to both sides, acting as a robotic mediator.
- **Sarcastic Verdicts**: Expect to burst out laughing when Dispute Dismantler delivers its judgment, infused with Bender's trademark cynicism and irreverence.
- **Randomized Humor**: The AI's random decision-making elements ensure that every resolution is a surprise, mixing seriousness with humor to relieve tension.

### Disclaimer:

While DD offers a fun approach to settling lighthearted disputes, it is not a substitute for a legal expert. Please refrain from using Dispute Dismantler for serious legal matters.

### Getting started

To ensure the correct use of speech recognition and synthesis features, you must create an Azure AI Speech Service and obtain the corresponding API key. Additionally, to run OpenAI GPT models, you will require one of the following: the endpoint and key for Azure's OpenAI ChatGPT completion resource or an OpenAI API key.

It is recommended to use GPT-4 Turbo (gpt-4-1106-preview) over GPT-3.5, as it tends to generate results with greater stylistic sophistication.

### This app is an entry for the Hack Together: The Great .NET 8 Hack hackathon.

#### Current limitations:
Error handling, code style, and UI/UX need improvement. Bender would say upon looking inside: "This hunk of junk is sub-par! It needs bending. Come on, get it to my level of perfection – do it before I lose interest... which is happening... now!" :)
